With a background in human factors, she launched her first app, Gratitude Journal (www.getgratitude.co), in 2008 and it instantly shot up to #1 and was hailed in the major news publications around the globe–all on a meager $500 budget. Her apps thrive in the top of the iTunes charts for years and are continually featured USA Today, Oprah, NPR, LifeHacker and countless other publications, making organic growth possible as well as raising money for charity. She has created a successful formula to bring app ideas to market faster and to take iTunes by storm–all without breaking the bank–which she shares in her top selling book, Idea to iPhone.",
